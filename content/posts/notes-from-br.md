> “It's fascinating how we -human beings- keep believing and looking for good in life regardless of our inner weaknesses” - Personal reflection


I've been silent for months. Perhaps it's due to the AI revolution and how it's transformed the landscape of writing, from essays to academic papers.

Speaking of AI, I initially panicked like many others when witnessing the early demos, questioning my professional worth. This anxiety peaked when I first used GitHub Copilot. However, after reflection, I realized my perspective was flawed. As a developer, I've always leveraged tools and existing code; the only difference was that previously, I manually searched and adapted solutions, feeling more engaged in the problem-solving process. Now it's automated, which can feel like cheating-but it's merely a paradigm shift in how we use tools that have always assisted us.

My initial understanding of AI was also misconceived. What we currently have are Large Language Models trained on vast datasets. These systems can't genuinely innovate solutions to complex challenges like climate change or faster-than-light travel.

Losing my job during an economic downturn led me to examine how deeply I'd tied my profession to my identity and self-worth. Here, I must recommend "Status Anxiety" by Alain de Botton, it helped me separate professional achievement from personal value.

Recent events in the Moroccan tech community (particularly on Twitter) revealed concerning dynamics. While I understand the human need for validation, it's troubling to witness individuals channeling narcissistic tendencies through manufactured drama and baseless attacks on groups like GeeksBlabla, simply because they no longer feel included.

A tech community is, by definition, "a group of individuals united by their passion for technology." Claiming ownership or special privileges over such a collective is fundamentally misguided. Moreover, attacking those who disagree with your narrative reveals a deeper issue.

Communities, like natural systems, thrive when they maintain healthy core values and clear leadership rotation. No individual should hold permanent advantages. Survival depends on merit and contribution.

The underdog narrative becomes problematic when it transforms into a platform for self-aggrandizement. Denying the role of luck in our achievements misrepresents reality and inflates personal credit.

Luck is indeed a numbers game-you can improve your odds through persistence and repeated attempts. However, the deeper aspects of luck your inherited intelligence, emotional resilience, genetic predispositions, or birthplace are entirely beyond our control.

Before claiming complete ownership of your achievements, consider this: we are complex biological systems processing inputs and generating outputs. The influence of our genetics, environment, and accumulated knowledge far outweighs our conscious control over decisions.

While I'm tempted to share my views on the Middle East and Morocco, I'll honor discretion. I'll simply state: May peace prevail, and civilian casualties cease.
